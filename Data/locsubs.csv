I'm very new to CGM and seems to be helping already in the first week of doing it. 

[A few pictures](https://imgur.com/a/QRoOF1q)

For some details, my hair is color-treated. I do low-poo every time I wash my hair, but I use twice as much conditioner each time. I just need to start using my detangling comb in the shower as opposed to right after when I apply detangler and oil. I also just started plopping with a cotton t-shirt, but I can't figure out how to pineapple my hair at this length. Other than that, I just need a bit of guidance on a few things:

1. What type of curl am I working with? I'm thinking I'm a 2B, but not entirely sure.

2. Should I be using a mousse or a gel? My biggest struggle right now is my hair losing curl shape, especially after the first day (I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days). I would love more hold of curl definition and volume if possible, but since my hair is so long I feel like I should avoid products that are too heavy. Thoughts?

3. Does my product list seem good? I use the LOC method. Here's the list in order of use:

- For **shampoo**, I've been alternating between [Carol's Daughter Sacred Tiare](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/sacred-tiare-sulfate-free-shampoo/820645226203.html?cgid=hair-collection-sacred-tiare), [Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/black-vanilla-moisture-shine-sulfate-free-shampoo/820645226067.html?cgid=hair-collection-black-vanilla), or [Shea Moisture Peace Rose Oil Complex](https://www.sheamoisture.com/peace-rose-oil-complex-nourish-silken-shampoo.html?gdffi=8b472ad5fa4e4ed0ba0fc37b196c73c8&amp;gdfms=43AC16A6C581435C811AC256C132DBFC).

- For **conditioner**, same as above. [Sacred Tiare ingredients](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/sacred-tiare-fortifying-conditioner/820645226166.html?cgid=hair-collection-sacred-tiare), [Black Vanilla](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/black-vanilla-moisture-shine-hydrating-conditioner/820645226036.html?cgid=hair-collection-black-vanilla), [Peace Rose Oil Complex](https://www.sheamoisture.com/peace-rose-oil-complex-nourish-silken-conditioner-764302216315.html?gdffi=8b472ad5fa4e4ed0ba0fc37b196c73c8&amp;gdfms=96DBD02A0B894333963A55EDDB70BE2B).

- For **detangler** I use Sixteen92 Detangling Mists *(ingredients: Purified water,  aloe vera gel, vegetable glycerin, mallow root extract, polysorbate 20, fragrance blend, liquid germall+ (preservative), vitamin e)*

- For **leave-in conditioner**, I use [Carol's Daughter Sacred Tiare](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/sacred-tiare-leave-in-conditioner/820645226173.html?cgid=hair-collection-sacred-tiare) or [Black Vanilla](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/black-vanilla-moisture-shine-leave-in-conditioner/820645226043.html?cgid=hair-collection-black-vanilla#sz=999&amp;viewall=1&amp;start=3&amp;cgid=hair-collection-black-vanilla) leave-in conditioner, or [Shea Moisture Peace Rose Oil Complex](https://www.sheamoisture.com/peace-rose-oil-complex-nourish-silken-leave-in-treatment.html?gdffi=8b472ad5fa4e4ed0ba0fc37b196c73c8&amp;gdfms=C884D6BB4F7D4021ADB6624B53C0B031) or [100% Virgin Coconut Oil](https://www.sheamoisture.com/100-virgin-coconut-oil-leave-in-treatment.html?gdffi=8b472ad5fa4e4ed0ba0fc37b196c73c8&amp;gdfms=1234277778424AFB94872A148021CC62) leave-in treatments.

- For **hair oil**, I use Sixteen92 Supernatural Hair Serum *(ingredients:Argania Spinosa (Argan) Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Camellia Oleifera (Camellia) Seed Oil, Limnanthes alba (Meadowfoam) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance Blend, Leucidal (preservative))*

- For **texturizer**, I use Sixteen92 Sea Salt Hair Mists *(ingredients:Purified water, aloe vera gel, dead sea salt, coconut oil, epsom salt, mallow root extract, polysorbate 20, fragrance blend, liquid germall+ (preservative))*

- For cream, I just started using this and I've been trying out [Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls](http://missjessies.com/Pillow-Soft-Curls_2). Not sure if this is CGM friendly or not, and if I should use this in addition to a mousse/gel or not.

- When I do a deep conditioning treatment (once every week or two), I've been trying out either [Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen &amp; Restore Treatment Masque](https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-restore-treatment-masque-jbco.html) or [Raw Shea Butter Moisture Recovery Treatment Masque](https://www.sheamoisture.com/raw-shea-butter-deep-treatment-masque.html)

&amp;#x200B;

i've been using the CG method for most of this year to try to define my 2B/2C curls. when i started, i was using silicone and sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner (kiehl's colour-preserving sunflower oil) 2-3 times per week and following up with the LOC method (unfortunately i don't remember the products i used for that, except the oil was also from kiehl's) and plopping with a thin t-shirt.  i found it pretty good, my hair felt softer and my curls were slightly more defined. i eventually switched to shea moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus curl &amp; shine shampoo/conditioner 2 x per week due to the price of the kiehl's stuff, following up with an oil (loreal elvive extraordinary oil) and a gel (devacurl ultra-defining), + plopping. i found this gave me much more definition but nothing i tried gave me the volume i wanted and i had a sort of weird curl pattern at the roots, so i dropped the gel and have let my curls be a bit more relaxed lately. throughout this whole time i've only used heat extremely rarely, always plopping then air-drying, and never brushed my hair unless in the shower and covered in conditioner (lots), with a wide-tooth comb.

&amp;#x200B;

however, for the second half of this year - i'm pretty sure it started while still using the old kiehl's products - my hair is constantly tangled and always falling out. even directly after coming out of the shower, which i finish with detangling, my hair straight away feels tangled and dry. i'm leaving hair all over the place and when i detangle there is so much more coming out than ever used to. this has resulted in my hair now being much, much thinner than it's ever been before and i hate it. nothing has changed in my life - if anything i'm less stressed - and no new medications, climates or anything. i'm going to the hairdresser mid-december and probably going to just cut it off (mid-back to shoulders) because it's stressing me out and upsetting me! but i'll also ask her for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

i was just wondering if anyone here has experienced this or knows of anything that could be causing it? i want my hair back! thank you in advance for any help you can offer.

I tried the Baobab &amp; Tea tree oils low porosity protein-free conditioner but I felt like it didn't moisturize my hair enough.)

My hair seemed to love these products during the summer (I live in an EXTREMELY humid climate), so I went on and purchased the BIG bottles. Once it started to get colder though, I noticed that my hair was getting dry and brittle. I did a deep condition with Melt into Moisture but my hair felt like straw as soon as I applied the conditioner and gel!! I experimented by adjusting the amount I used or by keeping the conditioner for a longer period of time, but nothing really worked. 

Has anyone experienced something similar to this? If yes, what was the cause? Protein overload? Or lack of moisture? How did you overcome that situation? Did the LOC method help you? 

I've been using Acure Organic's Argan Oil series with the Beautiful Curls Defining Gel and since this incident and so far I really like the results! My hair feels soft and moisturized.

I can only throw my hair up into a pineapple or bun and it *always* looks sloppy and messy and ends up a frizz ball by noon.

I do all the things to help my hair, get regular cuts..never use chemicals or heat on it and it’s still just dreadful. I don’t pull my hair too tight when I wear it up and sleep with a satin pillowcase. 

I also think a large part of why I hate my hair is because of the drastic difference in curls that I have on my head. The bulk of it is a 2b/c wave and then the outer perimeter is like a 3b/3c curl. I have very little breakage and I know my porosity is low to medium. I follow the LOC method and that has definitely improved my  curly definition but it’s not enough.

1. co-wash with local/cheap conditioner with coconut oil in it. 

I leave the tiniest bit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Then I dry by gently pressing with a micro-fiber towel. Hair is too short to either plop or crunch... 

&amp;#x200B;

3. I then apply a tiny bit of olive oil, as I think my high-porosity hair benefits from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Just the tiniest amount and gently rub that in my hair in a backwards motion. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Then I apply a light gel, the same as the fourth step. I use two finger tops. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Air dry for minimally two hours and then scrunch out the crunch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really hate the air drying part. It looks absolutely ridiculous  before I can scrunch out the crunch. That's why I don't like too much product. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank's a lot in advance!!!

New guy here. A couple of days ago I read the intro to CG and went straight ahead to a store to find the right products to start using the CG method. Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.

I got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.

Being the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:

Routine per lavare i capelli \[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\]

\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \[se possibile V05 clarifying\] (da riusare non più di una volta al mese)

\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.

\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa

\[S2C\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Ripeti fino a lavare via tutto il balsamo.

\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati

\- **Asciuga** ""sgranocchiando"" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.

Per aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.

\[Plopping\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.

Dopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare ""sgranocchiando"" i capelli.

\- **A capelli asciutti**. ""sgranocchia via"" la ""croccantezza"" causata dal gel, con le mani

&amp;#x200B;

\[SOTC\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.

\[Super Soaker\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.

\[Finger coiling\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.

\[LOC\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto

\[Rake &amp; Shake\]: not found

\[Shingling\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Alcol:**

Alcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)

Altri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Siliconi:**

Son divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perchè possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.

1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.

\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest’ultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)

2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, però, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perchè vengano rimossi.

\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane

3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l’accumulo non è troppo. È comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.

Dimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.

4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l’uso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.

Behenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Umettanti:**

Da evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.

Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)

Se hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in più possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidità dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosità dei ricci:

0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.

1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi ""sgranocchia"" un po' i ricci.
2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e ""sgranocchia""
3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e ""sgranocchia"" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)
4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). ""Sgranocchia"" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.
5. Agita i ricci e ""sgranocchia"" mentre sei a testa in giù. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.

In particolare, quando fai attività sportiva, è una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Porosità:**

I capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosità.

Questi due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosità dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)

Oppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)

Bassa porosità:

I capelli impiegano più di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua

L'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli

I prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perciò si accumulano di più in mezzo ai capelli

I capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi

I capelli sono più resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)

\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda

\- Usa gli heating cap

\- Metti i capelli in plastic caps (non so come si chiamino, ma hai capito) e usa un asciugamano riscaldato

\- Usa prodotti più leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan, grapeseed, sunflower, sweet almond). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli

\- Usa con una certa regolarità un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.

Alta porosità:

Si bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua

I capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa

I capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati

Accettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.

Possono sembrare pesanti e secchi

Si annodano facilmente

Tendono a essere crespi

\- Usa oli pesanti (castor, olive, coconut, olive, flax, hemp, jamaican black castor) e ad alta tenuta

\- Usa settimanalmente un balsamo ""deep""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've tried everything; I've had the most success with the LOC method, but I had to cut out the oil I was using (which was just olive oil, admittedly) because it was building up too much. So right now I stick purely to the V05 Coconut Conditioner and the Cantu Coconut Curling Cream. I thought I had a protein issue as well, so I tried the DIY Protein Treatment found on the naturallycurly site, and that seemed to help...for about a day, before it almost got even worse. And that's the story with my usual method, too; things stick together for a day before it just all falls apart into frizz again and again and again. 

I live in a desert, and I ride a bike around for transportation - I know that probably sucks any semblance of moisture out of my hair daily. But I feel like using the LOC method with any kind of thicker conditioner is going to kill any kind of volume I have because of how heavy said conditioners can be, and the curl already only really starts to happen once it drops past my ears...

Legit crying rn. 
ok so recently i tried LOC method.  
I used
 Curls leave in conditioner
Caster oil by shea (only used on front because front of hair is high porosity) 
Aragan oil (used on back because of low porosity) 
Curls blueberry bliss curl jelly.  (cremes stay on top of my head and make is REALLY stiff)  was using cantus curl activator before but it was awful
Shampoo is doves intensive repair (use once every two weeks) 
I use canto cowash (every other day)  
Conditioner is shea moisture manuka &amp; honey because coconut is to heavy for my hair.  
Also I got a soft bonnet hair dryer because hot air opens the cuticles.  
I put conditioner in,  make sure its all over my hair and go under the bonnet for 15-20minutes
then I wet my hair again,  wash a LITTLE bit of conditioner out then begin my process. 

Curls leave in
Caster oil (front) 
Aragan oil (back) 
Gel
get my 9 row silicon brush from sallys and brush.  I watched a TON of YouTube videos on how to use it and the pictures you see are a result. 
I even bought a diffuser because I heard it helped.  Watched a ton of videos on that.

So this issue has been going on for a long qhile and after trying so many different products with no success, I decided to try asking here. 

My hair is always frizzy in one section, and doesnt absorb any kind of product whether its a leave in, oil or cream. I was thinking this means it's low porosity, right? (Is it possible to only have low porosity hair in one section?) But, I've tried applying produts in the LCO/LOC method and all the above and still my hair doesnt cooperate. 

I've been natural for ~3 years and havent noticed this problem as much, probably because the rest of my hair wasn't as great and it wasn't so noticeable. Now that it IS noticeable, I'm just looking for any and all advice lol.

So I have pretty thick curly hair with straight hair on the bottom. I recently found on my hair is low porosity but nothing has been working so far for it. The best product that works for my hair is argan oil conditioner (blue bottle). It provides my hair enough hold to keep my curls from frizzing out. But the problem is it weighs it down a lot and second day hair is impossible. Also the product buildup is the worst and makes my scalp itchy. 
Not sure what to do because I know low porosity should avoid heavy products but it seems like my hair doesn’t hold its curl otherwise? 
I’ve also tried using Camille Rose curl love moisture milk along with as I am curling jelly. I have tried LOC method as well as LCO. 
I’ve been deep conditioning using the argan oil conditioner and then washing out some but not all, I deep condition by wrapping a plastic bag around my head and putting a beanie on over that to hold in heat.
For shampoo I use tea tree eden body works natural shampoo. 
Not quite sure what else to do. I want the results the argan oil conditioner gives me without having to wash my hair every day from the product buildup. And yes I’ve tried using less product but it just leaves my hair frizzy and lifeless.

Either stuff like combs or towels or products like shampoo and conditioner.

Routine:

I usually put castor oil in my hair an hour before showering. 

Shampoo + Conditioner: Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo and Conditioner

Leave-in: Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave-In Conditioner

Curl Cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curls

I shampoo and scrub my scalp with a brush to remove dandruff. Then I add a good amount of conditioner to my hair and squish while rinsing.  I find the LOC method good for keeping in moisture for a little longer than usual, so after showering, I add my leave-in to my slightly dripping hair and plop for 20-30 minutes. After, I add a small amount of mineral oil throughout, scrunch in a generous amount of curl cream, and air dry.

I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for, just hoping for some advice before I cut all my damn hair off. I like to stay pretty low maintenance when it comes to my hair care routine - Wash and Go is the dream. However, I can't seem to make it work. Buckle in.

My hair is long - a little past my shoulders when curly.  I think I'm 3B/3C? Biracial. My hair takes FOREVER to dry - I believe that means it has high porosity? 

My general routine is to co-wash with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Conditioner, and then remove as much excess water as I can with a microfiber towel. I use the LOC method with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner, Palmer's Cocoa Bitter &amp; Biotin Length Retention Shine Glaze Serum, and SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Detangle with a wide tooth comb. Plop with the microfiber towel for about 20 minutes, then let air dry the rest of the way.

If I were to do this, and then sit with my head perfectly still for like five hours while my hair dried, it'd look perfect, lol! I think my product selections are okay? However, as soon as I take my hair down and it starts rubbing against the back of my shirt, or I get in the car and have to move it over my shoulder so that it doesn't rub against the car seat, it starts getting all wonky. Not frizzy, per se, but the curls just separate so much that they start looking odd. My the time 11:00 am rolls around, my curls are looking pretty janky and my hair's still wet so it just gets worse as the day goes on. 

I've tried detangling inside the shower instead. Tried using my fingers instead of a comb. Tried using a brush instead of a comb. Tried adding in some LA Looks gel to make it stay in place. Tried wet pineappling at night instead of in the morning (just makes my curl pattern look even worse). Tried plopping overnight, same issue. Don't even ask me about second-day hair... I can do it, but it doesn't look great. I pineapple my dry hair when trying to make it a second day, but I am such an active sleeper that it's not successful. 

It feels like my hair is just too long to manage without heat styling, but there's nothing I loathe more than spending my morning blow-drying my hair, lol. 

Do any of you longies have a wash and go routine that actually results in pretty curls? Or am I just too lazy for this curly life?

It's my first time using reddit, hope i'm doing it right ^_^

So... I'm struggling a lot with my hair, and i need some help, YOUR help amazing gorgeous curly People !

I am half french, half malagasy, and my hair are Also mixed, from what i see, i have 3 types of different texture on my head

On the front and the side, my hair are type 3c, tight fine curly hair, quite high porosity
On the bottom back i have thick wavy hair perfect shine, super healthy, normal porosity (why my head ain't like this everywhere :()
Annnd on the top back, i have super puffy hair, really dry, hard to define , high porosity

The thing is, i don't know how to tame this mess
I've started the LOC methode 8 months ago

Starting with the mixed chicks gently cleanse shampoo (with those silicon massage brush) 

Next a mask (if i do one) lately it's the shea moisture strenghen and restore treatment mask or the 10-1 multi benefit mask, with a heat cap for like an hour usually

After that, i put some conditionner, in the begining it was the pink paradise conditionner from les secrets de loly (a french brand) but i changed because i wasn't convinced by it, so now i'm trying the boucleme conditionner, but i'm not super fan too, i don't know, it doesn't seem enough to nourrish my mess, i always wash all of it because i have super thin hair, and i lack of volume and like the next step already put enough weigh on my head

Then i start the Loc without drying my hair at all

For the L i was using the Milk hair smoothie from les secrets de loly, but even if my hair was rly soft, it turns it quite oily and it feels like too much for my fine hair, now i'm using the boucleme curl cream as a leave-in, but my hair is so oily with this :( (yet the texture seems lighter and i have slightly more volume)

Then i'm finger coiling or using the denman brush

Scrunching with the mane serum oil mist

And i end this with applying gel, before it was the kinky curly curling custard, it worked but i wanted to try something else, so now i'm using the boucleme curl défining gel, and i like it yes

And leave it dries naturally

The thing is, i do believe i should use different product because the result is so différent between the front and the back, like it's hard to keep définition on my back (i'm doing pinneaple with satin bonnet) 
Plus my hair seems always so oily x(
Also i lack of volume so muuch, i don't know what to do
I'm afraid that the product for fine hair won't nourrish my hair enough but Maybe i should try it ?

How to ameliorate my hair routine ? :(

I suffer from dandruff also because years ago I'd under moisturize my hair but recently i realized my dandruff isn't as bad as before since i started taking interest in my hair.

On regular days of the week (Mon-Sat) I'll use the moisturizer alone but on Wednesdays, I'll use the moisturizer and the leave-in conditioner just to keep my hair moisturized during the week. One thing to note too is that I would moisturize my hair after the first shower and in the night I'll just wet my hair and that's all. I suffer from dandruff also because years ago I'd under moisturize my hair but recently I realized my dandruff isn't as bad as before since I started taking interest in my hair. Something else I realized is that at the crown of my head my hair is thinnest there and compared to the front and sides of my hair, the crown has the least amount of hair. I did an online thing on those sites to determine what porosity of hair I have but I've forgotten it but what I remember is that a question asked if I can see my scalp easily if I separated my hair a little and it was. I just need advice and need to know if I am doing the correct thing to my hair and if I need improvements or I need a new routine as it would greatly be appreciated.

I just FINALLY mastered my wash day routine for the best possible outcome. Since I’ve been quarantined, I’ve been experimenting with different hair routines.
I’m half black and half white, I have medium 3c/4a hair with high porosity. 

WASH 
I fill a spray bottle with apple cider vinegar and section my hair. 
I proceed to mix an Aztec clay mask with acv to the consistency of a milky yogurt, i section my hair, spray down the sections, and apply the mask. I let that sit for 15 min, rinse, then apply the Shea moisture Manuka and honey deep conditioner ! I left that in for 30-45, then rinsed with COOL WATER. 
I always do this once a week.

PRODUCT APPLICATION
After I’ve washed, I use the LOC method - I use the olaplex leave in conditioner, coconut oil, and the Shea moisture curl stretch cream. I apply the carols daughter honey mimosa pomade as a scalp moisturizer! I also use a steamer while I’m applying my product to open the cuticle and allow full penetration.

STYLING
Since we are quarantined right now, I’ve just been doing two strand twists and leaving them in for a week and just repeating the process every Tuesday. 

after my wash, pre product application, my hair was VISIBLY and PHYSICALLY softer! My hair accepted the product so well!!

Current routine (changes slightly - still trying to figure out what products/ingredients/applications work for me.

-cowash with As I Am Coconut Cowash. First time doing this but no problems so far. I was using Shea Moisture Hibiscus Shampoo &amp; Conditioner


-deep condition (always bc dry). Was using Mielle Babbasu &amp; Mint deep conditioner but ran out so I’ve been using Aussie 3 minute deep conditioner and not loving it. Squish to condish and let sit for anywhere from 10-30 minutes

-Cantu Leave in - I’ve tried a few leave ins and this one doesn’t seem to work as well. It seems like I need a lot of it. 


- Cantu curl cream - I LOVE this stuff


- I’ve learned I need gel since I’m pretty wavy. I haven’t branched out a lot here - LA looks or Giovanni L.A Natural Strong Hold Gel (hate the smell - won’t repurchase). 



I’ve tried LOC method where I’ll use Argon oil after cream and before gel. I also have a dry/itchy scalp if I go too long between wash days and find I have to clarify like once every month and a half or so. 

Really any advice to help lock in moisture and any guidance on what products to try or what ingredient to look for/stay away from would be helpful.
